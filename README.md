# AndroidApp
An android application created by Jackson Paris

Current Version 4/27/2020

This repository will be used for version control of our android application. The application is a proof of concept for an android version of our hosted web app and will not be deployed on the android app store.

Usage

This code is completely open source, anyone is free to take what I've started on this application and expand on it with credit to Guadr.
The application currently still has bugs and is definitely not complete.
Development on this application requires downloading Android Studio and cloning the Android App repository. The code is fairly well commented and should be pretty simple to expand upon. Right now there is no mapping or payment integration within the app which will need to be implemented along with bug fixes before the app is ready for deployment. Also the current database is just stored on local phone storage and is very much not secure, this will definitely need to be improved upon later.
